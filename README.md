# Micopi for iOS

iOS app that generates profile pictures for your contacts list.

Micopi allows you to assign a unique image to every person in your iPhone's or iPad's contact list. If you do not happen to have a (decent) photo of someone you know, you can use this app to simply generate one.

You can carefully pick a design for each individual contact or let Micopi assign its generative art to a whole bunch of phonebook entries at the same time.

Don't worry, your information is not saved in Micopi, used for other purposes or transmitted to us.

Please note, applying an image to a person cannot be undone. Micopi has been thoroughly tested but we recommend making a backup of your most precious contacts and pictures, just in case.
